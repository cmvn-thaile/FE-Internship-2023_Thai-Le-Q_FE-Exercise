              The shift to remote work is expanding to various industries beyond
              a temporary timeframe. It is not uncommon that your recruitment
              and other HR processes will have to be slightly adjusted. Here’s a
              highly practical checklist to ace the onboarding process.

            <h3 class="blog-content-title">1. Start with a crash course</h3>
            <p>
              A prerequisite to successful onboarding, or even long term
              success, is that you convey the relevant information about the
              organization. A SaaS platform looked at the issue of onboarding
              more closely, and showcased that 50% of new hires are retained
              more when organizations integrate effective onboarding, compared
              to competitor organizations that do not.
            </p>

            <p>
              The platform furthermore, reveals the importance of 5C in
              onboarding: compliance, clarification, culture, connection, and
              check back. The three former Cs especially support the importance
              of conveying the relevant information on the organization.
            </p>

            <p>Some useful tools to use in this regard are:</p>

            <p>
              Internal documents on the vision of the organization and long term
              goals, action plans, or other forms of work reports. To go one
              step further, you could always draft an onboarding internal
              document that summarizes the relevant information.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3 class="blog-content-title">2. Choose your channels wisely</h3>
            <p>
              There are two factors you would want to maximize through your
              onboarding process: productivity and adaptability for the new
              hire. It is estimated that it takes 8 months for a new hire to
              reach optimal productivity. Who wouldn’t want to accelerate that a
              little? You must therefore, set up all the needed technology and
              tools to ensure that the onboarding sets up a solid foundation for
              the recruit’s future performance in working remotely.
            </p>

            <p>
              To set the ground for maximum productivity, you must use
              productivity software options. Different software options have
              some great, user-friendly features that will allow to assign
              tasks, track, and communicate them very easily. Measuring
              productivity with the aid of these tools has never been easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              Adaptability, though, is a little trickier. Because remote work in
              itself makes even the best of us feel isolated, adapting to it may
              naturally be more so to new hires.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the digital shift has given rise to advanced tools
              crafted specifically to connect remote teams. Among the most
              feasible tools to make your new hire feel more included are
              virtual co-working spaces. These virtual spaces have the ultimate
              office-y toolkit: separate conference rooms, lounge areas, and
              presentation options. Apart from their effective features in
              providing an “office-but-better” option, data show that virtual
              co-working spaces are increasingly being used for avoiding
              isolation and bringing back a team spirit in remote work.
            </p>

            <p>
              The top channel picks for a smooth onboarding experience include:
              Asana, Trello, Todayly, and Slack.

              3. Be precise with expected results
            </h3>
            <p>
              Saving yourself valuable time as a manager and avoiding any
              productivity bumps along the way requires specific goal-setting
              for the recruit. As Harvard Business Review puts it:
            </p>

            <blockquote cite="#">
              More than anyone else the hiring manager understands what his or
              her people need to accomplish and what it will take — skills,
              resources, connections — for them to become fully effective.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              HBR goes furthermore on what is required for setting out clear
              expectations and providing the right guidance. In this regard,
              many sources apart from the latter overlap in the following tips:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Give tasks with measurable outcomes or milestones</li>
              <li>Provide a time frame and set a calendar</li>
              <li>
                Conduct a weekly progress report to track completion of goals
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborate with the recruit on identifying long-term goals
              </li>
            </ul>

              4. Stay proactive to joint team meetings
            </h3>
            <p>
              Thanks to highly useful and affordable tools that bring an
              office-effect to you and your team, onboarding can be way less
              stressful than you might’ve anticipated. However, the same might
              not apply to new hires. As such, joint team meetings shouldn’t be
              underestimated during the onboarding process.
            </p>

            <p>
              Bringing the team together when onboarding new hires is key to
              breaking the ice and maintaining good team dynamics. Moreover,
              with all the necessary tools at your disposal, this is become a
              piece of cake. Here are some ideas for engaging the team during
              remote onboarding processes:
            </p>

            <p>1) Organize an introductory meeting</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conduct touching-base team meetings</li>
              <li>Rent a co-working space to hang in virtual lounges</li>
              <li>Organize virtual games for team bonding</li>
            </ul>
